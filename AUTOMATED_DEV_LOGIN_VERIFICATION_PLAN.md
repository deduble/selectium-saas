# Verification Plan for Automated Development Login System

This document outlines the verification plan to ensure the automated development login system is implemented correctly and securely.

## 1. Verify Backend Endpoint

-   **Action:** Write a Python script to directly call the `/api/v1/auth/dev/login` endpoint.
-   **Expected Result:** The script should confirm that the endpoint returns a valid JWT token and user information when `SELEXTRACT_ENVIRONMENT` is set to 'development'.

## 2. Verify Endpoint Security

-   **Action:** Modify the test script to call the `/api/v1/auth/dev/login` endpoint when `SELEXTRACT_ENVIRONMENT` is set to 'production'.
-   **Expected Result:** The script should verify that the endpoint returns a 404 Not Found or 403 Forbidden error, ensuring it is properly secured.

## 3. Verify Frontend Integration

-   **Action:** Review the browser's developer console when launching the frontend with `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_AUTO_LOGIN=true`.
-   **Expected Result:** Look for the "Development auto-login successful" message and confirm that the application automatically logs in without any user interaction.

## 4. Verify User Experience

-   **Action:** Confirm that after the automatic login, the application is fully functional and the user is correctly identified as `yunusemremre@gmail.com`.
-   **Expected Result:** The user should be able to navigate the application as the specified user. The logout functionality should also work as expected.

## 5. Verify Disabling the Feature

-   **Action:** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_AUTO_LOGIN=false` in `.env.dev` and restart the frontend.
-   **Expected Result:** The application should no longer attempt to automatically log in and should instead present the standard login page.

This verification plan will thoroughly test the new feature from end to end, ensuring it is both functional and secure.
